### Description

This is a [US Peace Corps Virtual Service Pilot](https://www.peacecorps.gov/volunteer/virtual-service-pilot/) (VSP) project that started on November, 2023. It is not a US Peace Corps Volunteer project. The current project is a collaboration between CCCD Jamaica and [Peace Corps Jamaica](https://www.peacecorps.gov/jamaica/). 

**Note**: VSP Participants are currently Returned Peace Corps Volunteers and private US citizens donating their time each week in service of the Peace Corps mission. They are not Peace Corps Volunteers.

Project status and updates can be found on the main GitHub Project page: [https://github.com/CCCD-Jamaica](https://github.com).

The initial website will be developed in SvelteKit to speed up the project. We will add Drupal, or another web editing solution, during the later phases.

All content will be provided by CCCD Jamaica with efforts to incorporate content from their Deaf students. IT teachers, students, and staff will take part in the development of the project.

We will add a Jamaican Sign Language Resource component during Milestone 4 of this project.
